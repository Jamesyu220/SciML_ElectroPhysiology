# EP-PINNs

Matlab files to simulate the cardiac (ventricular) Aliev-Panfilov electrophysiology model in a cable (1D) and rectangular (2D) domain with Neumann boundary conditions and several initial conditions (single ectopic focus, planar wave, spiral wave). The code also supports the inclusion of heterogeneities in D (which are rectangular, for the time being). Centred finite differences and a 4-step explicit Runge-Kutta solvers are used throughout.

Future releases will include arbitrarily-shaped heterogeneities and the simulation of unipolar electrophysiological signals, as well as more detailed documentation for the code. Further details can be found in a soon to be published article. In the meantime, email marta.varela (at) imperial.ac.uk for any comments or questions.
