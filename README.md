Matlab files to simulate the Aliev-Panfilov model in a cable (1D) and rectangular (2D) domain with Neumann boundary conditions and several initial conditions (single ectopic focus, planar wave, spiral wave). The code uses centred finite differences and a 4-step explicit Runge-Kutta solver. 

Further details can be found in a soon to be published article. In the meantime, email marta.varela (at) imperial.ac.uk for any comments or questions.
